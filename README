STAFFY

A simple application for managing project teams. 

We plan to build the following views:

Plan a project
--------------
Estimate how many people your project will need, and when
 * Add people to a project
 * Estimate how many hours (by week) will be needed for each person
 * For past weeks, see how much people actually worked

Timesheets & Priority setting
-----------------------------
Track what you're working on and communicate it to everyone.
At the beginning of each week:
 * For each project you work on, jot down the high level list of issues you'll tackle this week.  Also see the estimated # of hours that have been allocated for you by project
 * See last week's priorities notes, and add comments on how that worked.
 * Once info has been added, an email will be sent to the team

Person view
-----------
For a given person, check out their current and estimated workload.
 * list of projects, with hourly assignments by week
 * for past weeks, see what notes were written
 
Dashboard
---------
Overview of what everyone is working on.
 * view of the current week
 * by project / person - estimated hours plus self-written priorities
